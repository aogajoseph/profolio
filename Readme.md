# PROFOLIO

Hi there, my name is Joseph Okoth. I'm popularly known as Joseph Aoga accross several social media platforms. This is my professional portfolio dubbed Profolio which also serves as my online resume and official website. On it, you'll learn more about me and how to get in touch.

Some sections are intentionally disabled as the website is bound to future updates. The processes of making updates is still underway as I intend to make the website as great as possible while remaining brutally honest. I just want to make sure that the website depicts my personal image, from my personal information to my professional background, skills and everything else found on it.

If you find the template useful, feel free to fork the repository, reach out for a chat and don't forget to leave a star behind.

Let me know your thoughts on Profolio.

Kind regards.
