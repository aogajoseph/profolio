# PROFOLIO

Hi there, my name is Joseph Okoth. I go by Joseph Aoga on social media. 

Welcome to my professional portfolio alias Profolio. It serves also as my official website and online resume. On it, you'll get to know more about me and learn how to get in touch.

Some sections were intentionally excluded to allow future updates. The processes of updating the website with newer features is continous and my plans are to make the website as perfect as possible and be brutally honest with the information it relays. Essentially, it must reflect my personal image and all I have to offer. For instance, my personal information, professional background, skills and everything else.

If you find the project useful, feel free to fork the repo or reach out for a chat and don't forget to leave a star behind.

What are your thoughts on Profolio? 
I'd love to hear them!

Kind regards,
Joseph Aoga.
